Focus on your goals‚ù§Ô∏èüïäÔ∏è
A knowledgeable etiquette chatbot powered by Mypdf.

Introduction
This project demonstrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot using Hugging Face's Inference API, Gradio, and FAISS for efficient similarity search. The chatbot, named "Focus on your goals‚ù§Ô∏èüïäÔ∏è" is designed to provide help regarding focusing on your goals and help to manage stress.

Features
Uses the Zephyr-7b-beta model from Hugging Face for natural language processing
Implements RAG to provide context-aware responses
Utilizes FAISS for efficient similarity search in the knowledge base
Provides example prompts to demonstrate the chatbot's capabilities
Offers a user-friendly interface powered by Gradio
Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have the following:

Python 3.6 or higher
A Hugging Face account (sign up at huggingface.co)
Installation
Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/Gaganjotkaur4368955/Customized-LLM-APP.git

Install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the PDF of real estate investing and place it in the project directory with the filename Mypdf.pdf.

Usage
To run the chatbot locally:

Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
Run the following command:
python app.py
Open your web browser and go to the URL displayed in the terminal (usually http://127.0.0.1:7860).
How It Works
The chatbot loads the PDF of Mypdf and processes it into a vector database.
When a user asks a question, the system searches for relevant passages in the etiquette guide.
The retrieved context is then passed to the LLM along with the user's query.
The LLM generates a response based on the provided context and its training.
Customization
You can customize the chatbot by modifying the following in app.py:

Knowledge base: Replace Mypdf.pdf with another PDF to change the chatbot's knowledge domain.
System message: Edit the system_message variable to adjust the chatbot's behavior and tone.
Model: Change the InferenceClient to use a different model from Hugging Face.
Examples: Modify the examples list to showcase different interactions.
